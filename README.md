# Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to help Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, tabulate results for a U.S. congressional precinct. This analysis uses the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. With the use of Python, we are able to provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. Along with the the number and percentage of votes each candidate recieved.

# The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  In addition to finding the total votes casts within the entire election, coupled with a breakdown of each county, it was important to hold the same analysis for each candidate. This would allow us to detect how many votes each candidate recieved along with indicating who won the election and by how much. 
  The results show that Diana DeGette won the election with a vote count of 272,892 or 73.8%.Charles Casper Stockham followed in 2nd place with 85,213 or 23% and lastly Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 or 3.1%.
